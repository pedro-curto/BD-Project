# BD-Project

This is a project made in a group of three for my Databases course. It consists in three deliveries:

- In the first delivery, we had to draw an **Entity-Relationship diagram** and define **integrity constraints** to represent the **problem domain**
- In the second delivery, we had to translate the previous delivery to a **Relational Model**, present some expressions with **Relational Algebra**
and translate the Relational Model to **SQL**, and provide a script to populate it
- In the third delivery, we had to define **integrity constraints**, **queries**, **views** and **OLAP operations** in **SQL**; develop a simple **web
application** with products, suppliers, deliveries and payments, and create and explain **indexes**.
